### Phase 1 User Scenarios:

Amanda is a 10th grade high school student in Chicago taking a Mandarin course.

Jenny is a 12-year-old second-generation Mandarin speaker living in Vancouver, Canada.

Chelsea is a 27-year-old English woman living in London.  As a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, she is learning Chinese to share her beliefs with Mandarin speaking people in her neighbourhood.

**Scenario 1:** Chelsea wants to prepare her magazine presentations for a particular magazine article, so she goes to http://www.jw.org/zh-hans on her computer, finds the magazine article in Simplified Chinese.  She clicks on **the Convert Characters to Mand (pinyin) Chrome extension** button, which does what it says.  Comparing with the English version of the same magazine article, she prepares her presentation by copying, pasting and editing the Mand text on the web page.

**Scenario 2:** Chelsea wants to be able to prepare for her Christian meetings in Chinese.  She downloads an ePub publication from http://www.jw.org/zh-hans in Chinese on her iPad.  From her computer, she goes to **the Convert ePub to Mand Web app**, chooses the epub she downloaded, and gets a new epub that converts all characters to Mand.  As a learner, she chooses to convert it with tone marks.  She gets the converted version, syncs it to her iPad, and reads it in iBooks.

**Scenario 3:** Chelsea wants to look up information on a Chinese CD-ROM borrowed from the library.  Using the library computer, she copies the text into **the Convert Text to Mand Web app**, which does what it says.  On screen guides on the webapp helps her to understand the text, and provide links to external dictionaries if she wants to dig more.

**Scenario 4:** Amanda's Mandarin class teacher gives her a group assignment in learning how to make jiaozi (Chinese dumplings).  She goes to Google and types "zenme zuo jiaozi" in Mand.  She gets the search results back in Chinese characters, clicks on **the Convert Characters to Mand (pinyin) Chrome extension** button and the page turns into Mand.  She surfs as normal, and all text is shown in Mand.  There is a video embeded in the web page and she plays the video to learn how to make jiaozi.  She looks up certain words she doesn't understand, makes the jiaozi with the help of her Chinese parents, and brings it to share with her class.

**Scenario 5:** Amanda fells in love with a Chinese pop song and wants to know the lyrics so she can sing it.  She can find the lyrics in pinyin on the web, but these don't have proper word spacing and she finds it hard to learn the meaning of the words.  She copies the URL of the site on her mobile phone and pastes in **the Convert Web Page to Mand Web app** that converts the page to Mand.  She taps on the converted Mand text and get a tooltip showing her the English definition.  She then clicks on a link in the tooltip and goes to an external site in a new window with a more detailed English definition.

**Scenario 6:** Chelsea finally decided to apply to a school in China.  She downloaded her application form in Microsoft Word, opens it in Google Docs, but find it hard to understand Chinese characters.  She clicks on File > Download As > Web Page (.html, zipped), (this is 2015), unzips it, opens it in her browser, clicks on **the Convert Characters to Mand (pinyin) Chrome extension**, and reads the document in Mand with the help of tooltip translation.
